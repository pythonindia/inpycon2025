## Talks and workshops

Following are the guidelines each speaker must follow. These are there to ensure the event is neutral and more in the spirit of open source.

1. Each slide must not have a logo or equivalent that represents a company/organization.  
   *You may have a company logo where you introduce yourself, but speaker details should be more prominent.*
2. No product or hiring pitches are to be done during the session.
3. If any external images or resources are used, credits or links to the source must be mentioned on the slide or at the end.  
4. If your session is about a commercial/non-open source product, a major part of your session must be about the technical implementation details of it.  
   *This is to ensure that your session doesn’t become a product marketing session and that attendees benefit from your learning.*
5. Your talk and slides must follow the [PyCon India Code of Conduct](https://in.pycon.org/2025/coc/policy/).

*Note that some of these might not apply to the sponsored sessions.*

### Tips
Here are some of the best practices that would help you make your sessions better.

1. Have an introduction slide where you talk about yourself.  
   *This helps the attendees get to know you, why you are talking about the topic, and also helps them answer “Why should they listen to you?”.*
2. Add interactive elements to your talk, this can be as simple as asking a show of hands or a quick quiz.
3. Keep your demos recorded. This can save you at times when things just break, you don’t have Internet connection and so on.
4. Add slide numbers, this helps attendees to take notes during the session.
5. A must-read: [Accessible Speaking Best Practices](https://www.deque.com/blog/accessible-speaking-best-practices/) this also has actionable steps.
   1. Ensure the font size is large enough so that it is visible to the attendees from the back.
   2. Consider using a light theme for slides, as the contrast and visibility of the light themes is more in general.
   3. If you are showing code live, close all sidebars, extra tabs etc. to make it distraction free.


## Panel Discussions

**Duration**: 30 minutes (including Q&A)  
**Format**: Group discussion with 3-4 panelists and a moderator

### Responsibilities

**Moderators**:

* Coordinate with panelists in advance.  
* Prepare a clear agenda and set of discussion questions.  
* Ensure balanced participation and respectful dialogue.  
* Facilitate audience Q&A.  
* Consider setting the questions in a way to ensure the panel discussion caters to all levels of audience.  
* Conclude the discussion with takeaways or highlights. 

**Panelists**:

* Keep remarks concise to allow time for others.  
* Respect diverse viewpoints and foster inclusive discussion.

### Tips

* Focus on discussion, not presentations.

## Poster Presentations

**Duration**: 1-2 hours (during dedicated poster session)  
**Format**: Visual display + informal, one-on-one or small-group discussions

### Guidelines

* Design a clear, readable poster (recommended size: A0 or 36"x48").  
* Include: title, names, affiliations, problem statement, approach, results, visuals, and contact info.  
* Be present at your poster during the scheduled session to discuss your work.  
* Provide a QR code linking to your code, paper, or project website (optional but encouraged).

### Tips

* Use visuals over text. Keep explanations simple and engaging.  
* Prepare a 1-2 minute “elevator pitch” for passersby.

## Lightning Talks

**Duration**: 5 minutes maximum (strictly enforced)  
**Format**: Fast-paced, single-speaker presentation

### Guidelines

* Arrive 10 minutes early with your presentation on a USB drive or cloud link.  
* Stick to the time limit—there will be no extensions.  
* Use no more than 3–5 slides.

### Tips

* Focus on one idea: a project, tip, or call to action.  
* Be energetic and engaging—lightning talks are crowd favorites!

**Note: Talks exceeding 5 minutes will be politely cut off.**

## Open Spaces

**Duration**: 30–60 minutes (flexible)  
**Format**: Self-organized, participant-driven discussion or activity

### Guidelines (Facilitator/Host)

* Define a clear purpose or goal for the session (e.g., “Brainstorming Python in Education”).  
* Create a welcoming space for all attendees to participate.  
* Manage time and wrap up with key takeaways (if applicable).

### Tips

* Have a round of introductions as it gives a chance to everyone to speak up and works as an ice-breaker.
* As the room is shared, respect time limits and clean up afterward.  

**Remember: Open Spaces are community-powered. Come ready to share, listen, and collaborate.**

## Dev Sprint

**Format**: Collaborative coding and onboarding

### Guidelines

* Represent your open source project or community initiative.  
* Prepare beginner-friendly issues (labeled “good first issue”).

**Goal: Help others contribute meaningfully and grow your community.**
